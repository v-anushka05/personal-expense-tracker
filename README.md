### OpenAPI Schema
See [`openapi.yaml`](./openapi.yaml).

### Keploy API Testing (Chrome Extension)
- API tested using the Keploy Chrome Extension and [https://app.keploy.io](https://app.keploy.io)
- Test cases generated for all CRUD endpoints.

**Test Evidence:**
![Keploy Test Report](./keploy-test-reports)

### Postman API Test Results
API endpoints were also tested using Postman for local verification.

![Postman Test Results](./testimage.png)

### Sample cURL Commands
```sh
# Create expense
curl -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"description":"formal shoes","amount":100,"category":"Shopping","date":"2025-06-27"}' \
  'http://localhost:5001/expenses'
# List expenses
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:5001/expenses'
```

### CI/CD Integration (GitHub Actions Example)
> **Note:** Keploy CLI is not supported on Windows Docker Desktop due to kernel limitations. API testing was performed using the Chrome Extension and web platform. Example workflow below:

```yaml
name: Keploy API Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  keploy-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Show Keploy CLI Limitation
        run: echo "Keploy CLI is not supported on Windows Docker Desktop. See README for details."
```

### Keploy Chrome Extension on Public Websites
- [x] Used the Keploy Chrome Extension to record and generate tests on two public websites.

**Test Evidence:**

![Keploy Chrome Extension Test 1](./image1.png)
- Website: Reqres.in
- Action: Clicked "List Users" to trigger GET /api/users.

![Keploy Chrome Extension Test 2](./image2.png)
- Website: JSONPlaceholder
- Action: Loaded /posts endpoint in browser to trigger GET /posts.

> **Replace `image2.png` and descriptions above if you used a different site for your second test.**
